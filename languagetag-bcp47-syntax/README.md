# Languagetag BCP47 Syntax

This package provides parsers and tools for analyzing
[BCP47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) language tags. Note that the tags
supported by this package are merely well-formed: they conform to the formal
grammar of a BCP47 language tag but are not necessarily valid, so they may not,
for instance, be composed of subtags that are registered in the IANA language
subtag registry.
